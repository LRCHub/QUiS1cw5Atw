Who survived? Somebody new?
Anyone else but you?
So suffer the signs that you needed to change
Heed all the ways you'd been thinking
And though I know
Since you've awakened her again
She depends on you, she depends on you
She'll go alone
And never speak of this again
We depend on you, we depend
I'll depend on you
I'll depend on you
(Something-)
Remember when we used to fight?
I'd stay up all night
Trying to put it behind me (Something comforting)
