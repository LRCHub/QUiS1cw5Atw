If I send this void away
Have I lost a part of me?
When you wake, you're bargaining
For the promise to come back
'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Oh, there must be something wrong with me
And getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Someone tell me something comforting
