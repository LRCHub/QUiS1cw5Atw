It's so holy, it's so ho—, so lonely, so holy
To want about you, to want about you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you
It's so holy, it's so ho—, so holy, so holy
To want about you, to want about you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream of you, you, you
Dream—

If I send this void away
Have I lost a part of me?
When you wake, you're bargaining
For the promise to come back

'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Oh, there must be
Something wrong with me
And getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Someone tell me
Something comforting

Take what you want, but you're tied by the tooth
Wasn't it meant to relieve you?
So suffer the signs that you needed to change
Heed all the ways you'd been thinking

'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Oh, there must be
Something wrong with me
'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Someone tell me
Something comforting

Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting

Something comforting
