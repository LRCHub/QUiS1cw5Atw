[00:13.99] If I send this void away
[00:20.27] Have I lost a part of me?
[00:27.08] When you wake you're bargaining
[00:32.28] For the promise to come back
[00:46.28] 
[00:39.40] 'Cause getting made you want more
[00:42.73] And hoping made you hurt more
[00:45.97] Oh there must be
[00:48.96] Something wrong with me
[00:52.76] And getting made you want more
[00:55.81] And hoping made you hurt more
[00:58.94] Someone tell me
[01:02.12] Something comforting
[01:12.12] 
[01:59.57] Take what you want, but you're tied by the tooth
[02:06.61] Wasn't it meant to relieve you?
[02:12.45] So suffer the signs the you needed to change
[02:19.88] Heed all the ways you'd been thinking
[02:38.38] 
[02:26.03] Cause getting made you want more
[02:29.49] And hoping made you hurt more
[02:32.45] Oh there must be
[02:35.66] Something wrong with me
[02:39.01] 'Cause getting made you want more
[02:42.68] And hoping made you hurt more
[02:45.87] Someone tell me
[02:48.89] Something comforting
[02:58.89] 
[02:52.31] Something comforting
[02:55.70] Something comforting
[02:59.12] Something comforting
[03:02.29] Something comforting
[03:05.76] Something comforting
[03:08.93] Something comforting
[03:12.54] Something comforting
[03:15.96] Something comforting
[03:25.96] 
[03:35.90] And hoping made you hurt more
[03:39.01] Oh there must be
[03:42.24] Something wrong with me
[03:45.80] 'Cause getting made you want more
[03:49.44] And hoping made you hurt more
[03:52.42] Someone tell me
[03:55.77] Something comforting
[04:05.77] 
[04:21.71] Oh, something comforting
